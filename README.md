# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project

# What was the problem you were solving?
The project involved building a command-line course catalog system that allows users to load course data, view a sorted course list, and search for specific courses with their prerequisites. The client was a simulated educational institution needing an efficient way to organize and search course offerings. The system had to support multiple underlying data structures (Vector, Hash Table, BST) to compare performance and behavior.

# How did you approach the problem?
I implemented the system using a vector, hash table, and binary search tree to compare their efficiency. Data structures were key in determining how fast the program could load, search, and display data.

# How did you overcome roadblocks?
Some issues I ran into included validating data from the input file and adjusting the logic for each data structure. I resolved these by testing each component separately, handling edge cases like missing fields, and reusing as much logic as possible between versions to stay consistent.

# How did this project change your approach to software design?
It taught me to think about performance and structure early in development. I also learned to write modular code that could be reused or updated easily when switching between data structures, which is important when designing flexible and scalable systems.

# How has it improved your programming style?
This project improved my focus on clean, readable, and maintainable code. I now better organize logic, handle errors, and separate concerns to make code easier to understand and extend.
